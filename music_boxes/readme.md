NYC Sound Scape
======================
JS Mini Project (December 2015)

Coded with JavaScript, HTML5/CSS3 & Bootstrap

In this project, we had to use the in browser sound control functions to build a sound scape.The basic requirements for this app were:
* Users should be able to have different buttons to control different sounds.
* Users should be able to turn on and off sounds as they want.

It was completely up to the developer to come up with theme of the sounds and the look and feel of the app.

I  thought it would be fun to make this a NYC sound scape and put some of my favorite New York musicians and also New York City sounds together to give the user an abstract sound of what they city can be like.
