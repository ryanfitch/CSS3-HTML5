HTML5/CSS3
============== 
This repository contains different case studies and extra projects I built while learning HTML5/CSS3, API's, and JavaScript.

### Portland API's 
* This was a site I built wanting to explore the Flickr API and also a Weather API.  For fun I focused these API's on the great city of Portland.  
* The site was coded with AJAX, jQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS and the Flickr & weather API.
* Live site is here: http://ryan-fitch.com/freshportland/

### Music Boxes
* This site was a sound collage experiment.  I was exploring some of the web browsers audio capabilities and wanted to paint a picture of a soundscape in NYC.
* Coded with Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
* Live site is here: http://ryan-fitch.com/soundboxes/

### Chuck Norris Joke Machine
* I wanted to explore different API's so I built a site using the ICNDB (Chuck Norris DataBase) to access random Chuck Norris Jokes.
* Coded with AJAX, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML/CSS3 and the ICNDB API.
* Live site is here: http://ryan-fitch.com/chucknorris/
